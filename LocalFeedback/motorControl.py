This code is for precise electronic alignment and is meant to be used before the automatic alignment to attain initial coupling using 
feedback from the photodetector (or ThorLabs powermeter by eye). This program allows you to type in commands (in the form "motor, stepSize") 
and it will make the corresponding adjustment.

getPower() takes the parameter, n, and returns the average of n photodetector measurements. I have found the n = 100 works well.
The function reads the data aquisition plate channel which converts the signal from analog to digital. At the end of the loop,
the function converts the voltage measurement to milliwats in optical power and rounds it to 4 decimal places.

    power = 0
    for i in range(n):
        power+=DAQ.getADC(0,0) #(addr, channel) â€“ returns voltage from single channel

moveBy() takes parameters motor, duration, and direction and sends electrical signals to the driver to rotate the stepper motor 
appropriately. Changing the variable, delay, will change the speed of the motors.
