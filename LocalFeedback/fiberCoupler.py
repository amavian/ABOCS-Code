This code is for fiber coupling using the motorized steering mirrors with local feedback. 

It features the functions getPower(), moveBy(), findMax(), singleMotorOptimization(), walkBeam(), and continuousOptimization().

These are described in more depth below.

All plotting code was removed.

getPower() takes the parameter, n, and returns the average of n photodetector measurements. I have found the n = 100 works well.
The function reads the data aquisition plate channel which converts the signal from analog to digital. At the end of the loop,
the function converts the voltage measurement to milliwats in optical power and rounds it to 4 decimal places.
'''

    power = 0
    for i in range(n):
        power+=DAQ.getADC(0,0) #(addr, channel) â€“ returns voltage from single channel

    return round(((power-0.016)/1.02),4) #Calibration of the photodiode voltage to milliwats in optical power

appropriately. Changing the variable, delay, will change the speed of the motors.

I found that the power distribution across each degree of freedom (under ideal laboratory conditions) is approximately Gaussian.
Therefore, a simple hill climbing algorithm can be used to optimize any given degree of freedom.

findMax() takes  the parameter,  motor, and optimizes its position to maximize the coupling efficiency. It returns the final power 
measurement. The function begins with large step sizes and makes coarse adjustments mapping out the power distribution. When the 
function detects it is going in the wrong direction, it will turn around and decrease its step size, making finer adjustments until 
it converges on the maximum power. 

Unfortunately, the hardware issues resulted in the motors occasionally skipping steps. This effect, and hysteresis in the motors in 
general, were more pronounced at larger step sizes. To combat this, I implemented a "catch mechanism." The findMax() function maps
out the power distribution, finding the approximate maximum. It then goes back with a finer comb and stops when it gets within a 
certain margin of the recorded approximate maximum. In this way, we can assure that the program doesn't over shoot the maximum.

walkBeam() takes the parameter, motors, and mimics the process of "walking the beam" through an iterative method of perturbations 
and compensation. The parameter, motors, is a list of either the two horizontal or two vertical degrees of freedom. The function
works by detuning one mirror and running the findMax() function on the other mirror. If the resulting power is greater, it continues
in that direction. If it is less, it changes direction. Over time the step sizes get smaller and the system converges on the global maximum.

continuousOptimization() currently takes the parameter, n, and attempts to stabilize the power over n iterations. However, the idea 
is for it to run indefinitely once perfected. This function is fairly rudimentary. It works by rotating through each motor and makes
adjustments looking for improvements in power. If it detects a "significant" drop in power, then it will run the findMax() functions
to return to high coupling.
